# Assignment 3: AI Model for Object Detection (Standard)

## Assignment Instructions

Train a standard AI model (not on custom data) with the goal of later implementing it on the Jetson Nano. Choose a suitable tool, for example, NVIDIA TAO, Ultralytics, PyTorch, etc.

## Choice of Object Detection Tools
Select one of the following tools to train the model:
- [ ] NVIDIA TAO Toolkit
- [ ] PyTorch
- [ ] Hugging Face Transformers
- [ ] Ultralytics (YOLOv5/YOLOv11)
- [ ] MMDetection

## Grading Criteria
The student will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **ONNX Model Export**  
   - The trained model has been successfully exported in ONNX format and is ready for deployment.

2. **Training Code Accessibility**  
   - The code used for model training is available on GitHub and well-documented.

3. **Demonstration Video**  
   - A demonstration video of the model is accessible via the provided YouTube link:
